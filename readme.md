###  Description:
This mod adds 4 new entities to the game, that can automatically farm grass, twigs, berries and reeds for you. 
They can only be crafted using Dark Motes (added to the game by the Dark Matter mod). 
The recipes can be found on the Ancient tab and require a Science Machine to be learned. 
Once placed they require Nightmare Fuel to start and to keep working. How much and for how long will they work is up to you. 
Also configurable via the mod settings is the range of the Dark Farmers, as well as how often they perform actions. 
In order to feed them you have to place Nightmare Fuel in their containers and they will consume it when needed; you may also place fertilizer in the containers of the Dark Berry-Farmer and Grass-Farmer and they will automatically fertilize plants when necessary. 
But, keep in mind that they are only active when you are in the same world; for example, if you placed farmers in the outside world, they will stop working once you venture into the caves (or further below), and resume when you come out.

###  Additional information:
To install this mod you simply have to subscribe on the Steam Workshop and it will automatically be downloaded the next time you access the mods menu in the game.</br>
If your game crashes in the mod menu, try disabling __Small Textures__ in the game's settings.</br>
If you have any suggestions, feel free to post them in the comment section on the Workshop page.
